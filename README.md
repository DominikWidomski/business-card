# Business Card generator

> This is for personal usage, and only generates limited types of business cards. If you want to add your own style please fork this repo.

Tired of paper? This little PWA will allow you to generate your own business card, which you can simply add to your phone.

## Usage

To create your own Business Card, follow these instructions:

- Visit [this link](https://alexcanessa.github.io/business-card/make) from your phone (_if you use iOS, open it with Safari_).
- Complete the form and submit, this will take you to the card page. _You can also submit the form to preview the card, go back and submit again_
- Add to your home screen.
  
Done! ðŸŽ‰

## Rationale

I created this repo so that we can avoid printing loads of business cards every year.
On top of that, every new design can be easily published across all business cards in one go! 

## Development

I've built this as simpler as I could, with just raw HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS.
Ain't no linters or modules, so please just behave.

### Deployment

This repo uses GitHub pages off `main`, which deployes to `https://alexcanessa.github.io/business-card`.
